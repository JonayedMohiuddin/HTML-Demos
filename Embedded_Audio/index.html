To add an audio file to your page, follow these steps: 
1. Add the audio tag to your page. The <audio> tag indicates where an 
audio file will be placed. Where you place the tag in the code corre-
sponds to where the controls will appear.
2. Turn on controls. You can specify a control panel with the controls 
= “controls” attribute. This causes a small control like the one in 
Figure 6-19 to appear. If you leave this directive out, there will be no 
control panel, which means the user will not be able to play the clip.
3. Create a <source> element or two. Inside the <audio></audio> pair, 
add one or more <source> elements. Each source element indicates a 
file you will link to.
4. Set the src attribute to indicate the file. The src attribute of the 
<source> tag (could we please have one more thing with almost the 
same name here?) is used to indicate the file name of the audio file you 
wish to play.
5. Add alternate code for older browsers. Any additional HTML 
code between the <sound> and <sound> tags will be interpreted 
only by browsers that do not understand the sound tag. You can 
add an ordinary anchor to download the sound effect if you 
wish. This way, even those with older browsers can hear what 
they’re missing.
