    <h1>Some of my favorite sites</h1>
    <h2>Wikipedia</h2>
    <p>
      One of my favorite websites is called
      <a href = "http://www.wikipedia.org">wikipedia.</a>
      This terrific site allows ordinary users to enter
      encyclopedia definitions. Over time, the entries
      can be as reliable as a commercial encyclopedia,
      and a lot more complete.

      You can find out a lot about upcoming and current
      Dummies books at <a href = "http://www.dummies.com">

      book mentioned there.
